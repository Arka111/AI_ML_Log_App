# ML_AI_Log_App
Leveraging ML capability to improve platform stability and resilience

This application is part of dissertation of BITS Pilani WILP M.Tech in Data Science Engineering program. The goal here is to develop a system that is able to read application logs and predict applicative issues.

The following components are part of the framework.

1. Log Collection : Applicative logs generated are aggregated with tools like Kafka, ELK Stack etc.
2. Log Parsing : Convert unstructured log into structured events.
3. Predict issues : Feature extraction is performed on structured logs and models are applied to detect and predict issues.
